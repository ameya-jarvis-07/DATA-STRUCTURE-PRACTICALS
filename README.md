# DATA-STRUCTURE-PRACTICALS
This repo is a collection of all the practical I did while being in 2nd year (3rd semester) [2025-26] 


# 🚀 Data Structures Practical Programs – README
## 📚 Overview
This README covers interactive and single-run C programs for classic data structure and algorithm practicals. Each practical is explained with its features, a code summary, and how to run it.
 
### 1️⃣ Practical1.c – Linear Search 🔍
•	Finds an element’s index in an array using linear search.

•	Run: Compile and execute; searches a preset value from a static array.

•	Usage: Output directly shown on console.
 
### 2️⃣ Practical2.c – Binary Search 🕵️‍♂️
•	Locates a value’s index in a sorted array with binary search.

•	Run: Compile and execute; searches for a preset value in a sorted array.

•	Usage: Console displays the result.
 
### 3️⃣ Practical3.c – Selection Sort 🌟
•	Sorts an array using selection sort.

•	Run: Output displays the sorted array.

•	Usage: Compile and run, see sorted results in terminal.
 
### 4️⃣ Practical4.c – Bubble Sort 🫧
•	Sorts an array using bubble sort.

•	Run: Sorted array printed on console.

•	Usage: No interactive input; output shown after running.
 
### 5️⃣ Practical5.c – Quick Sort ⚡
•	Sorts using quicksort (recursive).

•	Run: Output is a sorted array after execution.

•	Usage: Command-line execution.
 
### 6️⃣ Practical6.c – Merge Sort 🔗
•	Implements merge sort on an array.

•	Run: Program prints the sorted array on completion.

•	Usage: Run and view results.
 
### 7️⃣ Practical7.c – Stack with Array 🥞
•	Menu-based stack: push, pop, peek, display.

•	Run: Choose actions using menu.

•	Usage: Input values to manipulate stack.
 
### 8️⃣ Practical8.c – Queue with Array 🚎
•	Implements basic queue: enqueue, dequeue, peek, display.

•	Run: Interactive menu for actions.

•	Usage: Enter values and choose operations.
 
### 9️⃣ Practical9.c – Array ADT Operations 📝
•	Includes full menu: create, display, search, insert, delete for arrays.

•	Run: Menu-driven, supports all major array manipulations.

•	Usage: Select action, follow prompts.
 
### 🔟 Practical10.c – Circular Queue 🔄
•	Shows circular queue: enqueue, dequeue, peek, display.

•	Run: Menu allows action selection.

•	Usage: Pick from menu for circular operations.
 
### 1️⃣1️⃣ Practical11.c – Priority Queue (Array) 🎯
•	Priority-based insertion and deletion with structure array.

•	Run: Supports insert, delete, peek, display.

•	Usage: Set priorities and process accordingly.
 
### 1️⃣2️⃣ Practical12.c – Singly Linked List (Menu) 🔗
•	Insert (front/end), delete (by value/index), display singly linked list.

•	Run: Menu-driven for each linked list operation.

•	Usage: Input values as prompted.
 
### 1️⃣3️⃣ Practical13.c – Singly Linked List (Alt) 🖇️
•	Alternate singly linked list with menu and interactive actions.

•	Run: Insert, delete, display via menu.

•	Usage: Use menu for all actions.
 
### 1️⃣4️⃣ Practical14.c – Binary Search Tree 🌳
•	BST functions: insert, delete, search, and inorder traversal.

•	Run: Manage BST through interactive console.

•	Usage: Provide value for BST operation on prompt.
 
### 1️⃣5️⃣ Practical15.c – AVL Tree 🌲
•	Balanced AVL tree: insert, delete, search, and all tree traversals.

•	Run: Interactive menu-driven structure.

•	Usage: Enter options for AVL tree management; supports in/post/pre-order traversals.
 
## ⚙️ Compilation and Execution Instructions
1.	Ensure a C compiler (such as gcc) is installed. 🛠️

2.	Compile: gcc PracticalN.c -o PracticalN

(Replace N with practical number, eg: gcc Practical7.c -o Practical7)

3.	Execute: ./PracticalN

 
## 💡 Notes
•	Interactive programs use menu-driven interfaces.

•	Arrays and queues use fixed sizes (MAX defined at program top).

•	Linked lists and binary trees need stdlib.h for dynamic memory (malloc, free).

•	Input/output done via scanf/printf; no file operations involved.

•	All outputs appear directly on terminal/console.
